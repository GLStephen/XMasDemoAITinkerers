### Project Goals
- Demonstrate AI-assisted development workflows
- Integrate with existing Atlassian tools
- Create reusable patterns for other teams
- Document everything for knowledge sharing

### Technical Approach
- Use Claude Code with MCP integrations
- Start with Confluence sync, then Jira
- Keep documentation in git as source of truth
- Automate what makes sense, don't over-engineer

### Timeline

- Sprint 2 (Dec 9 - Dec 20): Jira integration
- Sprint 3 (Jan 6 - Jan 17): Polish and demo prep
- Demo to broader team: Late January

### Team Responsibilities
- Project Lead: Stakeholder communication, roadmap
- Tech Lead: Architecture, code review
- Product Owner: Requirements, prioritization
- Developers: Implementation, documentation

## Decisions Made

1. **Use MCP for all integrations** - Standard approach, well-supported
2. **Markdown as source of truth** - Version controlled, developer-friendly
3. **Two-week sprints** - Enough time to deliver, frequent feedback
4. **Demo at end of each sprint** - Keep stakeholders engaged
