# Feature Request: Custom Templates

**Requested By:** Developer Team
**Date:** December 14, 2024
**Priority:** Low

## Problem Statement

Currently, epic and story formats are defined in the skill file. Teams want the ability to customize templates without modifying the skill.

## Proposed Solution

Create a template system that allows:
- Custom epic templates per project
- Story templates with configurable fields
- Meeting note templates
- Demo summary templates

## Expected Value

- **Flexibility:** Teams customize to their needs
- **Consistency:** Templates ensure structure
- **Onboarding:** New members use templates
- **Evolution:** Templates improve over time

## User Stories

1. As a PM, I want custom epic templates for different work types
2. As a developer, I want story templates that match our AC format
3. As a tech lead, I want meeting templates for different meeting types

## Technical Considerations

- Template storage location
- Variable substitution syntax
- Validation of required fields
- Versioning templates

## Questions to Resolve

- Where should templates live?
- How to handle template variables?
- Should templates be per-repo or shared?
- How to migrate existing content?
