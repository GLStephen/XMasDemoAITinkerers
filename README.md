# XMasDemoATTinkerers

This is a quick demonstrable slice of a workflow I've been building up for Claude Code. It seeks to allow a codebase to be a source of truth for docs and to expand beyond the Spec Driven Development approach and allow a dev to sync documentation to external sources and think more about translating and "content spinning" approaches to technical aspects of a codebase. This is party inspired by my work at [Black Airplane](https://blackairplane.com) an award winning development agency where we are defining the bleeding edge of modern development practices.
