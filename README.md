This is a quick demonstrable slice of a workflow I've been building up for Claude Code. It seeks to allow a codebase to be a source of truth for docs and to expand beyond the Spec Driven Development approach and allow a dev to sync documentation to external sources and think more about translating and "content spinning" approaches to technical aspects of a codebase which need to be communicated across the org. It includes a sample for creating Jira tickets and a sample for creating Confluence docs.
